Faster R-CNN became the first truly end-to-end, unified deep learning object detector, setting a new 
standard for accuracy. 
 
4. Single-Stage Object Detectors: A Focus on Speed 
Single-stage detectors remove the region proposal step and instead perform localization and 
classification in a single forward pass of the network, making them extremely fast and suitable for 
real-time applications.n\n
